===========

Not your calendar. Not your todo list. It's your system to achieve your goals.

What should OP help you with?

1. Present your most important tasks first.
2. Provide different visualizations of how important this task is. (Possibly later, why this task is important)
3. Create tree based tasked structures, but present them to the user as either a list for a topic, or a priority queue.
4. Provide encouragement when you succeed. I can be too hard on myself or forget about what I achieved. Instead only focusing on what I need to do.
5. Remind you to stay focused. I frequently get distracted and lose touch with what is really important.
6. Track what you do to keep you accountable to yourself.


Question to answer: 
  Different lists of things I need to visit later. An article I read mentions ideas, emails, phone calls, even things causing anxiety.
